    "    1. Do solar flares correlate to CME events?\n",
    "    We wanted to know if CMEs and Solar Flares happened together more often then not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Can we determine where we are in this cycle based on the trend of CME events?\n",
    "    The sun has an 11 year activity cycle, we wanted to know if we could see that trend with the CME and Solar Flare data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Is there a correlation between power of a Solar Flare and speed of a cME, when they happen at the same time.\n",
    "    We wanted to know if there was a link between CME speed and solar flare power when they coincided with each other\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. What does the \"type\" category for CME stand for? Can we infer a meaning based on some other category value?\n",
    "    In the CME data we found, there was a \"type\" column, but we could not find in the documentation what it meant.  \n",
    "    We wanted to see if we could figure it out"
